## How to use App
* Sign in with github into the application
* Enter a Correct username for which we need to see stats
* Wait for it to display the stats

## Basic idea of how application works
* Inorder to interact with github Graphql api , a bearer token is required
* This application utilizes github's Oauth service to get the user's bearer token which will be used to make further requests to graphql api of github
* But as bearer token is sensitive and should not be exposed to frontend , the request for bearer token is made at backend
* Once token is received at backend , it is encrypted using a secret key and sent back to frontend
* Now the user send's the username for which they want to see the stats , the encrypted token is also sent back along with this
* Backend decrypts the token and uses the username received username and makes an api request to github graphql api
* Once data is received , its sent to frontend to render

### Tech stack :
  * Reactjs - Vite for frontend
  * Nodejs - express-graphql for backend
  * Frontend deployed on netlify
  * Backend deployed on render.com
